# Contributing to Blink

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

I love to receive contributions from others! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Blink itself.

## Reporting bugs

Did you find a bug?

- Do not open up a Github issue if the bug is a security vulnerability and instead to refer to our [security policy][1].
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on Github under [Issues][2].
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- Try to use the relavant Github issue template

## Suggesting features/enhancements

Feature requests are welcome.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Blink, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs.
Open an issue on our [issues list on Github][2] which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Pull requests

I welcome code changes and merge requests. Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help.

To get started developing, check out the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

Please ask (feel free to open an issue) before embarking on any significant merge request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developer aka me might not want to merge into the project.
